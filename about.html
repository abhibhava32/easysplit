                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The primary purpose of the app is to to help groups of people easily manage and split shared expenses. It simplifies 
                    the process of splitting costs by allowing users to log expenses, 
                    assign amounts to individuals, and keep track of who owes whom. The app automatically calculates and
                    simplifies the debts, reducing the number of transactions needed to settle up.</p>

                    <li>View Details, Edit or Delete an expense entry made in group.</li>
                    <li>View Debt summary of who owes how much to whom. Also view complete summary of total expense made, amount to receive and total debt amount on each member of the group. </li>

                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

                <p>Welcome! I'm glad you are using my Easy Split app. I take your privacy seriously and want to be transparent about how I handle things here. Below is a straightforward summary of how this app works, what data it doesn’t collect, and what happens if you ever reach out to me directly.</p>

                <h2>Consent</h2>
                <p>By using the Easy Split app, you’re agreeing to this privacy policy and its terms.</p>

                <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>The app doesn’t collect, store, or share any personal information. It’s designed to be simple and doesn’t need your login details or any personal data. The whole idea is just to help people manage and split shared expenses without the hassle.</p>
                <p>The app lets you log expenses, assign amounts, and keep track of who owes what. It even simplifies payments by reducing the number of transactions needed. All of this happens without any of your personal data being involved.</p>

                <h2>Contacting Me</h2>
                <p>If you reach out to me directly (for support or questions), I might get some information like your name, email address, or phone number, depending on what you share. This info is only used to respond to your queries, nothing else.</p>

                <h2>No User Data Collection</h2>
                <p>Easy Split doesn’t require any account registration and doesn’t gather any personal data. I want you to enjoy using the app with peace of mind, knowing that your use is completely private and secure.</p>

                <h2>Log Data</h2>
                <p>Just so you know, if something goes wrong with the app, it might generate some log data to help diagnose the issue. This data can include things like your device’s IP address, the app version, and timestamps. This information is purely for debugging and improving the app’s performance.</p>

                <h2>Service Providers</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, I may work with third-party services to help keep the app running smoothly. These services might assist with app functions or analytics. If they have access to log data, it’s only to perform tasks on my behalf, and they’re bound by strict confidentiality agreements.</p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>I care about protecting your information, even though the app doesn’t collect much. While I strive to use the best methods available, no online system can be completely secure. Just keep this in mind when using any app or online service.</p>

                <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
                <p>The app may contain links to external sites. If you click on a link and leave my app, I encourage you to check out the privacy policies of those sites. I can’t control what they do, so be sure to stay informed.</p>

                <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
                <p>This app isn’t meant for anyone under 13. I don’t knowingly collect any personal data from kids. If I ever learn that a child under 13 has provided information, I’ll delete it right away. If you’re a parent or guardian and discover this, please get in touch so I can take care of it.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>I might update this privacy policy from time to time. If anything changes, I’ll post the updated policy right here. Any updates will take effect immediately after posting.</p>
